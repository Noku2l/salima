<h1>Connect with God</h1>
<p>God is well of love that won't dry dry. He made us with this hole in our hearts to be filled by him. God is greater than anything you maybe facing </p>
<h2>Sunday</h2>
    <p>There are so many things in life we can't explain. Often sometimes things happen for a reason and we are forced to deal with the outcome. There are people I think about everyday who are no longer present in my life. Simply due to choices.</p>
    <h2>Acceptance</h2>
    <p>It may be difficult but it's always worth it. Accept the things that are out of your control. Don't let them stay on your mind all the time, don't let them stop you from finding people and happiness</p>
